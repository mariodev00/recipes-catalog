        <h1>Trader Joe's Lobster Pasta</h1>
    <img src="../img/lobster-pasta" height="350">
    <p>If there is anything more decadent and satisfying to dig into than a steaming bowl of lobster pasta, I haven't found it yet. It's one of my favorite summer meals to treat myself to when the mood strikes, though this is a rarity because of how time-consuming and expensive all things seafood can be.
    <br>So when our Allrecipes team caught wind of a quick, easy, and affordable hack to make restaurant-level lobster pasta a weeknight reality, we knew we struck recipe gold. Possibly the best part of this dish is that it only requires a handful of ingredients—all from Trader Joe's for around $6 a person. We (finally) had to see what all the fuss was about.</p>
        <h2>How to Make Trader Joe's Lobster Pasta</h2>
    <p>To recreate it for yourself, sauté about half a diced onion and a few chopped garlic cloves in olive oil until soft, and then add in a hefty handful of halved cherry tomatoes. Cook that down until soft and fragrant, and season with salt and pepper before adding in the bag of (thawed and rinsed) lobster-copycat langostino meat and the container of TJ's lobster bisque.
    <br>Once heated through, brighten it up as Nicole does with crushed red pepper, Parmesan cheese, lemon zest, and lemon juice to taste. Finally, add in a pound of your favorite pasta shape. Stir everything together to let the starchy pasta mix with the creamy sauce, then finish it all off with a sprinkling of fresh parsley and some more Parmesan. Now dinner perfection is yours.</p>
