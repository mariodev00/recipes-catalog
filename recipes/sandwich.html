    <p>A Reuben is a grilled sandwich featuring corned beef on rye bread. The Reuben is a menu staple in Jewish-style delicatessens, but it's not technically kosher because it combines meat and cheese.</p>
    <h2>How to make a Reuben</h2>
    <p>Start by spreading the dressing on one side of each slice of bread. Then, assemble the sandwiches and butter the top of each one. <br>Place the sandwich, butter-side down, on a hot skillet or griddle. Butter the other side and flip the sandwich when the bottom slice is golden brown. Grill until both sides are golden brown, and you're all set!</p>
